# Geofencing-and-shape-file-using-Python
This is the first step for my project of Classroom Geofence Attendance System where we create a geofence for a classroom and do the automatic attendace system i will upload the code and complete project with code from data collection to model deployment
Geofence Definition: Specifies designated classroom areas using latitude and longitude coordinates.
User Location: Obtains the user's current location through IP address geolocation or GPS coordinates (if available).
Distance Calculation: Calculates the distance between the user and each classroom geofence center point.
Geofence Check: Determines if the user is within the predefined distance threshold of a classroom geofence.
